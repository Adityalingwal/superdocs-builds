A case_dir holds two folders: notice/ (the officer's letter, exactly one
file) and petition/ (the original petition documents). Default: ./data
Supported formats: .md .txt .pdf .docx

Actual charges appear in the SuperDocs Billing tab; ops_spent here is a
cap counter, not a bill.

The same five operations are exposed as MCP tools by mcp_server.py — both
doors call the core functions in this file; there is no second
implementation.
