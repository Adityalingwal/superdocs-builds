"""AI coverage judgement.

Word overlap can only locate material; it cannot tell whether the material
is sufficient — a contract ending in 2027 satisfies every keyword of a
request that demands coverage through 2029. So the locator hands each
request and its found material to the model, and the model's reading —
verified by code — sets the coverage bucket.
